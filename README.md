# WineScore
A group of scripts for predicting wine scores

It includes scripts for:
1. Multiple Linear Regression
2. Random Forest Regression
3. Support Vector Machines
4. Neural Networks

# WineScore requires Scikit-Learn, NumPy, and Scikit-NeuralNetwork. If you need to install 
any of these packages on a Windows machine, I highly recommend installing Miniconda first.
